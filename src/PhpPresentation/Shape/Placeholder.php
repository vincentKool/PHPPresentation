 * Description: Placeholders are created at the master and layout levels.
 * That is, they can be added and deleted at those levels but not at the slide level.
 * At the slide level they are only referenced or linked to the lower layout layer.
 * That is, a slide can reference a placeholder at the layout level but not at the master level.
 * Similarly a layout can reference a placeholder at the master slide level.
